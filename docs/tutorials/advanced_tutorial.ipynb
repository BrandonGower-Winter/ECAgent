    "before tackling this work. **Note:** This tutorial also assumes you are using `ECAgent >= 0.5.5`.\n",

    "the *Grass*, the *Wolves* eat the *Sheep* and *Grass* regrows after a random amount of time.\n",
    "The model is intended to show very basic population dynamics namely, the carrying\n",
    "capacity of an ecosystem with predation.\n",

    "Both the sheep and wolves expend energy every time they move. They gain\n",
    "energy by consuming the appropriate resource. If either a sheep or wolf gains enough energy,\n",

    "\n",
    "Above, we used the global `TagLibrary` and simply created two new tags\n",

  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "source": [
    "As you can see, `SHEEP` and `WOLF` tags have been created for us.\n",
    "You will also notice a `NONE` tag which always exists in any `TagLibrary` and has\n",
    "a value of `0`.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this, we can now label our `Sheep` and `Wolf` agents which we\n",
    "do when we call their base class' constructor using:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "super().__init__(agent_id, model, tag=Tags.TAG_VALUE)\n",
    "```\n",
    "where `TAG_VALUE` is either `SHEEP` or `WOLF`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rest of the `Sheep` and `Wolf` classes are pretty standard where we ensure each agent has\n",
    "a unique id, add an `EnergyComponent` to them and give them a random\n",
    "energy value based on the species' `gain`. If we don't specify an `energy`\n",
    "value when initializing the agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will also notice that we seem to be making use of a `SpeciesComponent`\n",
    "but never explicitly added it to our agents, that is where Class Components come in.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Class Components\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned before, it makes no sense to instantiate some components more than once.\n",
    "The `SpeciesComponent` is a good example of this because each agent of a particular\n",
    "species doesn't need their own `SpeciesComponent`, they can all simply use the same one\n",
    "by virtue of being the same species.\n",
    "\n",
    "With that in mind, how to actually achieve this? Well, in `ECAgent` we do this\n",
    "by binding or attaching components to an Agent's class. In other words,\n",
    "we create a class component, or a component that is the same component for\n",
    "all agents of the same type/class.\n",
    "\n",
    "We do this by doing the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "# Add Species Component to Sheep Class\n",
    "Sheep.add_class_component(SpeciesComponent(Sheep, model))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** that we won't run this code right now since we don't have a model object to pass\n",
    "to the component just yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "The takeaway from the example though, is that we can add a component\n",
    "to a class, and we do that by calling the `add_class_component` method.\n",
    "The 'agent' this component belongs to is then the Agent class itself, not\n",
    "any instanced object as is the case with regular components.\n",
    "\n",
    "To access a class component, you can use `get_class_component(ComponentType)` or\n",
    "the `[ComponentType]` shorthand we used when creating our agent classes (which is the same way you can access\n",
    "components on instantiated agent objects).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Environments\n",
    "\n",
    "ABM environments are not clearly defined. They can be\n",
    "void of characteristics or incredibly detailed recreations of\n",
    "real-world locations. Discretized multi-dimensional lattices or\n",
    "graph structures are common. In this tutorial, we will be making use\n",
    "of such a structure called a `GridWorld`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Simply put, a `GridWorld` is a two-dimensional grid-like environment\n",
    "where each grid cell represents a distinct location with unique x and\n",
    "y-coords. For example, a `3x3 GridWorld` will look as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "| __ | __ | __ |\n",
    "|--------|--------|--------|\n",
    "| (0, 2) | (1, 2) | (2, 2) |\n",
    "| (0, 1) | (1, 1) | (2, 1) |\n",
    "| (0, 0) | (1, 0) | (2, 0) |\n",
    "\n",
    "where `(x,y)` are the x and y-coordinates of the environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make use of a `GridWorld` environment, we must first import the submodule:"

    "The [ECAgent.Environments](https://ecagent.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ECAgent.html#module-ECAgent.Environments)\n",
    "submodule contains several types of environments that you can make use of including\n",
    "a continuous environment called a [SpaceWorld](https://ecagent.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ECAgent.html#ECAgent.Environments.SpaceWorld)\n",
    "and the [GridWorld](https://ecagent.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ECAgent.html#ECAgent.Environments.GridWorld) we will be using\n",
    "in this tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "When an agent is added to a `GridWorld` (or any spatial environment for that matter), it is\n",
    "automatically given a component called a `PositionComponent`. You do not need to create\n",
    "this component yourself, but you can access it by calling\n",
    "`get_component(PositionComponent)` on any agent that has been added to\n",
    "the `GridWorld` environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "For clarity, the `PositionComponent` is a simple class that stores an\n",
    "agent's x, y and z-coordinates:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "# Taken from ECAgent.Environments\n",
    "class PositionComponent(Component):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, agent, model, x = 0.0, y = 0.0, z = 0.0):\n",
    "        super().__init__(agent, model)\n",
    "        self.x = x\n",
    "        self.y = y\n",
    "        self.z = z\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We will not be making use of the `z` attribute since we will only be working\n",
    "in two dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The last aspect of the `GridWorld` we need to talk about is cell components.\n",
    "Recall that our predator-prey model consists of `Grass` entities that\n",
    "we have yet to create. Well it turns out that for each cell in our `GridWorld`, we\n",
    "need a `Grass` entity. Now consider a simple `10x10 GridWorld`, we would\n",
    "need `100 Grass` entities. If we wanted to add a component to the `Grass` entities,\n",
    "we would need to instantiate `100` of these components every time. Simply put,\n",
    "this is incredibly memory inefficient and will increase our model's execution\n",
    "time significantly (more so for much larger `GridWorld` environments).\n",
    "\n",
    "To combat this, we can make use of cell components which, under the hood,\n",
    "store components in a memory efficient manner. The catch is that these attributes\n",
    "need to be simple primitives (`int`, `float`, etc.). The following figure demonstrates\n",
    "the distinction between a standard `Component` and a cell component:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Figure showcasing the difference between a regular component and a cell component](./resources/cell_components.png \"Figure showcasing the difference between a regular component and a cell component\")\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a cell component you can simply use:\n",
    "```\n",
    "environment.add_cell_component('name', data)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "where `environment` is a `GridWorld`, `'name'` is the cell component's name and `data` is the initial values\n",
    "of said `attribute` for each cell in the `GridWorld`. You can use\n",
    "[Generators](https://ecagent.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ECAgent.html#ECAgent.Environments.DiscreteWorld.add_cell_component)\n",
    "to write custom initialization functions for each cell but a simpler solution is to just supply the\n",
    "data directly using a `list` or `np.ndarray`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "# Assumes a 3x3 GridWorld\n",
    "data = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]\n",
    "environment.add_cell_component('coins', data)\n",
    "```\n",
    "The above code will create a `'coins'` attribute which when viewed directly will\n",
    "just like a regular array:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "However, when viewed from the perspective of a `GridWorld`\n",
    "will look like:\n",
    "\n",

    "|:------:|:------:|:------:|\n",
    "| 6 | 7 | 8 |\n",
    "| 3 | 4 | 5 |\n",

    "are quite simple with `resource_generator` randomly turning on about 50% of the\n",
    "grass (resource) patches. On the other hand, `countdown_generator` assigns a random\n",
    "value to the `countdown` attribute which describes how many iterations it will take\n",
    "for a dead grass cell to regrow.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the `execute()` method, we loop over every agent and determine its `posID`. Given that\n",
    "the cell components are stored contiguously (i.e. In a 1D array), we need to convert the\n",
    "agent’s position from a 2D value, into a 1D value. We do this using the `discrete_grid_pos_to_id()`\n",
    "method included with `ECAgent.Environments` and store it as the `posID`. If the agent is a `Wolf` (i.e.\n",
    "`agent.tag == Tags.WOLF`), we get a list of all agents at its current position using the `environment.get_agents_at()`\n",

    "of `0.0` and if so, they are given a new random countdown value ∈ `[0, regrow_time]` and\n",
