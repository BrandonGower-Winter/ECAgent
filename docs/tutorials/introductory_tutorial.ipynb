    "Welcome to the ECAgent Introductory tutorial. We will be taking a look at some fundamental ideas that make-up the ECAgent\n",
    "framework. To get things started, make sure that you are at least a little familiar with the core concepts of\n",
    "the Entity-Component-System (ECS) architectural pattern. If you are not comfortable\n",
    "with ECS, see the [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_component_system) page for more information.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting Started:\n",
    "\n",
    "To start off with, you should make sure you have ECAgent installed:\n",
    "```\n",
    "pip install ECAgent\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have ECAgent installed, we can proceed to create our Agent-based Model (ABM).\n",
    "We will be recreating a simple model inspired by [[Dragulescu2002]](http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0211175).\n",
    "\n",
    "Our model will follow this simple procedure:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Agents will start the simulation with 1 coin each.\n",
    "* At each iteration, each agent will give 1 coin to another, randomly selected,\n",
    "agent.\n",
    "* After N iterations, our model will print out the wealth distribution of our agent\n",
    "population.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's get started!\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing we want to do is open up the Tutorial.py file, located in the /src/ directory. You should see a completely\n",
    "blank file.\n",
    "\n",

    "components, you should first make sure the agent has the component you are looking\n",

    "the complex environments that we will introduce in further tutorials.\n",

    "As a result of this functionality, you will not see an `Environment()` object being\n",
